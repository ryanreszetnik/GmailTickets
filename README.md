This was a Chrome extension that I made and published which allows you to automatically fill out your availabilities based on your Google Calendar for scheduling meetings. It was made using the Google Calendar API and some scripts that figure out your availabilities (different for reoccuring events and one time events) and then fills out the When2Meet for you.
